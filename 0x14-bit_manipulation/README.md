0x14. C - Bit manipulation



1. Write a function that converts a binary number to an unsigned int.

    Prototype: unsigned int binary_to_uint(const char *b);
    where b is pointing to a string of 0 and 1 chars
    Return: the converted number, or 0 if
        there is one or more chars in the string b that is not 0 or 1
        b is NULL

2. Write a function that prints the binary representation of a number.

    Prototype: void print_binary(unsigned long int n);
    Format: see example
    You are not allowed to use arrays
    You are not allowed to use malloc
    You are not allowed to use the % or / operators
3. Write a function that sets the value of a bit to 1 at a given index.

4. Write a function that sets the value of a bit to 0 at a given index.

5. Write a function that returns the number of bits you would need to flip to get from one number to another.

Write a function that checks the endianness.
